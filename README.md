# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to develop an HTML page that allows the user to filter and display data from a JavaScript file.
We created a table to display the data and added filter criteria for the data.   


##Results: 
The new webpage is relatively easy to use. The page provides a brief introductions and features five filter categories. 
1. The user can refresh the page by clicking on "UFO Sightings" on the top left of the page.

2. You can filter data by 1 criteria:

3. You can filter data by more than one criteria:

##Summary:
This site is a great starting point for us. Two drawbacks I found weere:
1. The serach field is case-sensitive. The table will not update if the user does not entere the information exactly as it is
stored in the JavaScript file.
2. The data is not comprehensive and outdated since its running from a data file. 
Improvements for the next iteration:
1. Removing the case sensitivity and adding the ability to search for key words in the comments column
2. Adding a date range or filtering by days of the week to see if there are more sitings certain times of the month
3. Expanding the data to include additional months/years
